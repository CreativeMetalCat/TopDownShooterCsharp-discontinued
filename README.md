# TopDownShooterC#-discontinued
This project is base of top down shooter game with base of level editor made using c# and FMOD audio library

# You can all that you want with this project
You can take it and made it into proper game
You can add fixes of features to that(project is not fully discontinued)
It's all about you

# Why development stoped
The GDI+ library of c# is not made for games and this causes flikering to appear(if someone will find how to fix this, you are really smart)
